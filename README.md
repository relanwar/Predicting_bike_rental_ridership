# Predicting_bike_rental_ridership
This project is about building a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts is gained. This project is the first requirement to graduate Udacity's Deep learning Nano-degree.
